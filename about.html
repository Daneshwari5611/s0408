      <img src="C:\Users\cw\Desktop\open_src\pro_img\lalashriram.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;display: block;" alt="lalashriram">
      <p style="margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 6%;">Lady Shri Ram College for Women, has long been recognized as a premier institution of higher learning for women in India. A centre for academic excellence and achievement, it is today one of the finest institutions for Social Sciences, Humanities and Commerce, while also offering a B.Sc. Programme in Statistics. Professional courses like Elementary Education and Journalism are among its strengths. Located at the cutting edge of knowledge, LSR has not just kept pace with the changing world, but has been the pioneering spirit behind many innovations in the field of education. The striving is to imbue the teaching/learning process with a unique blend of intellectual rigour and aesthetic and ethical engagement. </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 6%;">LSR is committed to nurturing and creating women who are equipped to be world citizens. Women who take pride in their culture and heritage but also have a cosmopolitan understanding of the world today and a sensibility that celebrates diversity in all its joyous vibrancy. LSR students understand that with the power of knowledge, comes the responsibility to translate it into creative citizenship. They recognize challenges as opportunities. LSR students are empowered with professional competence, an ability to assume positions of leadership with ease and shatter inhibitory glass ceilings. </p>
      <img src="pro_img/lsr-old-bldg.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;display: block;" alt="lsr-old-bldg">
      <p style="margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 6%;">An education at LSR enables women to reconcile excellence with humanity, to celebrate diversity and redefine notions of success. The emphasis is on a liberating and not a domesticating pedagogy.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 6%;">Established in 1956 in New Delhi by the late Sir Shri Ram in memory of his wife, the college had its modest beginnings in a school building in Daryaganj, Central Delhi, with 243 students, 9 faculty, 4 support staff and 3 distinct courses of study. The aim of the institution was to provide access to higher education of quality to women. LSR is a testimony to the farsighted vision of its founder and his indefatigable enthusiasm to actualize his dream.</p>
      <img src="pro_img/Arun-Bharat-Ram-Chairman-LSR.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;display: block;" width="300px" alt="Arun-Bharat-Ram-Chairman-LSR">
      <p style="margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 6%;">Today, the college is located in a beautiful 15 acre campus in South Delhi, has approximately 2000 students, over 150 faculty, administrative and support staff and 16 courses of study. The College became a byword for academic and extra curricular achievement, under the inspiring Chairmanship of industrialist and philanthropist, late Dr. Bharat Ram. An enlightened and supportive Board of Governors, drawn from the fields of industry, law, journalism, academics and the bureaucracy, assists the Chairman in the running of the college.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 6%;">After the sad demise of Dr Bharat Ram in July 2007, his successor Dr. Arun Bharat Ram has become the Chairman of the Board of Governors. The vision of creating a centre of academic and extra curricular achievement for women, of providing a context that emancipates the intellect and the spirit, of zealously guarding a space that develops critical thinking and rescues the imagination, has been actualized. The journey well begun, has infinite potential to evolve further setting newer standards of excellence</p><hr>

      <h1 style="color: brown;font-size:30px; text-align: center;">Our vision</h1>
      <p style="margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 6%;">Lady Shri Ram College for Women is an institution committed to nurturing young women who are equipped to achieve success in a rapidly changing, deeply inter-connected world. The college upholds the values of social justice, diversity and inclusiveness, and thus works to sensitise students to become creative citizens. These creative citizens understand the power of knowledge and the responsibility that comes with it, especially in the context of India. LSR is an institution that inspires young minds to work with optimism, grit and resilience in the pursuit of their goals. The institution prepares students to recognise challenges as opportunities particularly during difficult times, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. LSR shall continue to prepare its students with the self-confidence, skills and competencies they need to enter the world of employment or higher education. It shall continue to motivate young women to remain ethical, goal-oriented, and self-reflective. These young women can then confidently adopt positions of leadership, take healthy risks and shatter glass ceilings.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 6%;">The vision of the institution harbours the task of optimising young women’s intellectual potential by providing them a fine balance of guidance and freedom as well as opportunities to engage with novel learning experiences. The emphasis, as always, shall be on a liberating pedagogy that endows young women with the capacities needed to flourish in a technology-based, evolving, multi-cultural India. Providing egalitarian platforms, supporting students that come from disadvantaged backgrounds, focussing on students’ needs, connecting students to the realities of the world they live in, while infusing the traditional with the modern and professionalism with humanism, are at the core of the institution’s vision for the future. LSR continues to pursue this vision even in the online mode of classes. The institution remains alert to indications of what the future may bring, such as hybrid education and prepares to make the best of such possible scenarios. </p><hr>

      <p style="margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 6%;">LSR is a premier educational institution of the University of Delhi. Its student culture is as vibrant as its history is rich. LSR was established by the late Sir Shri Ram in memory of his wife in 1956. Sir Shri Ram was a visionary, a philanthropist and had a vision for women’s education. He saw education as an exercise in aiding the nation’s growth. We have come a long way from those early years. Today, the LSR community is a leading place for women to emerge as ‘sheroes’ of the world. Be it academics, extra-curricular or co-curricular activities, LSR has proven itself time and again.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 6%;">Even in monumentally challenging times such as these, with the pandemic, LSR has emerged as a beacon of excellence. We have maintained, even adapted well, to the new conditions of online teaching. We ranked 2nd in the country-wide NIRF rankings. LSR has produced several university rank-holders from different departments yet again. The students have won several awards. They have been placed at different institutions and companies nationally and internationally.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 6%;">LSR seeks to actively combat the challenges brought on by online education.

The committee has distributed laptops to underprivileged students from difficult economic backgrounds to ensure that no student is left behind. LSR’s rich and culturally vibrant community works in myriad ways to ensure equal access to education, online or offline. We also offered generous financial aid in the form of scholarships and freeships to students.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 6%;">LSR is a truly global community. We partake in multiple outreach programmes, international exchange programmes and initiatives. Students, in the course of their study, come across several outreach programmes that give them access to transform lives and the world around them. LSR has infrastructure that is world class as well. This year LSR also won the Green Cup again and won accolades for its green and clean campus. We have ICT-enabled classrooms, state-of-the-art seminar halls, open space and common rooms.

      <p style="margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 6%;">Workshops were also organised for teachers on the use of online platforms for teaching including Google Meet and Google Classroom.
